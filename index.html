        <p> Week 4: Logo Exercise
            In this exercise I have designed immaginary building construction company logo by creating 3D circular structure and a simple house-like pattern.
            The code draws a circular structure in the center, constructs a house-like shape, and adds curved text.</p>

            
        <p> Week 5: Animation Exercise
            In this exercise i have designed a canvas with 13 randomly colored circles that interact with a dividing line. Every time a circle comes in contact with the line, it splits into two smaller circles, and their colors change randomly.</p>
            

        <p> Week 6: Interaction Exercise
            This is a simple game. The player can move using the left and right arrow keys, shoot projectiles with the spacebar, and when they hit the randomly colored moving circle, the circle disappears, and the player earns a point.</p>
